<p>In this integration approach, you barely have to do anything ! What we do is we provide you with a few lines of code you need to put on your website, which our mutual clients will use to login to idibu, something like you can observe on our <a href="http://www.idibu.com/wldemo/goodrecruitment/">demo page</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.idibu.com/images/stories/Portal_logos/goodrecdemo.png" alt="" width="500" height="417" /></p>
<p>Which would lead your clients to an idibu website, but under your branding (and your URL!):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.idibu.com/images/stories/Portal_logos/goodrecdem22.png" alt="" width="784" height="512" /></p>
<p>And every email client will receive from your system will also be styled under your branding:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.idibu.com/wldemo/goodrecruitment/expiry.png" alt="" width="644" height="779" /></p>
<p>And it can be setup in a way, that all the idibu system links will point to your website (the same page used to login) so your clients will only see your brand, never idibu's!</p>
