This webservice allows to obtain data relating to Job objects of a given account. It can be used to list jobs same as [Ad Manager](https://v3-docs.idibu.com/article/776-ad-manager-2-0-intro-and-overview) in idibu.

A single Job object can consist of multiple [Adverts](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/webservices/advert-management), where each Advert indicates any single interaction between idibu and a posting destination (job board, website, or social media portal).

Creating Jobs and posting them as Adverts is handled through the [Posting API](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/posting-api) or [Universal Posting Pages](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/UPP).
