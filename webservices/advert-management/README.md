This webservice allows to obtain data relating to Advert objects of a given account.

A single [Job](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/webservices/job-management/job-management-webservice.md) object can consist of multiple Adverts, where each Advert indicates any single interaction between idibu and a posting destination (job board, website, or social media portal).

Creating Jobs and posting them as Adverts is handled through the [Posting API](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/posting-api) or [Universal Posting Pages](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/UPP).
