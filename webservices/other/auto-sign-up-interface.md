<p>This interface allows our partners to create their own idibu accounts without needing to go through the idibu&nbsp;Account Management team, giving you independence to work quicker.</p>
<p>The auto-sign up interface allows you to quickly set-up a fully functioning idibu account by performing three actions at once:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Creation of either a user-based or pay-as-you-go account type</li>
	<li>
		Addition of the admin user profile which is the minimum required to be able to post a job</li>
	<li>
		Activation of as many job boards as you like to post to</li>
</ul>
<p>It means you can hand out ready-to-go idibu accounts with very little overhead - its designed for job boards and partners to work with us.</p>
<p>In order to use the service contact <a href="mailto:good@idibu.com">good@idibu.com</a> to discuss your requirements, to agree a referral scheme, and to get a partner id created.<br />
