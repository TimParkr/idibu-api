To style your PCP, you will need to provide us with CSS files for the following posting stages:
<ul>
<li>1st step posting - the main UPP page. Styled with a single CSS file.</li>
<li>2 step of posting - the extra fields step. Styled with a single CSS file.<</li>
<li>success messahe - static HTML page. By default it will display: Thank you for finishing the posting. We will send you an email if any of the postings encountered any issue.</li>
</ul>
You can easily achieve different results, here are some of the examples for different partners:

Once you are ready with your own styling, send it to us to get it added to idibu. To use it, you will need your own partner id. This will be most likely included in your partner contract, but let us know if you feel that anything is missing!
