idibu integration's APIs
=========

idibu provides you with means of using our funtionality precisely how you would like it to run with your software! We provide you a variety of integration options that can either quickly introduce multiposting for you clients (our current record holder took 2 days to roll-out a working integration!) or rebuild almost whole idibu has to offer.

Not only that, we also give you options to whitelabel our page and fit it into your page - so you can have your own private idibu almost instantly.

The documentation is divided in the following options:

1. [idibu API](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/api-v3) - where you can learn all about how to post jobs using idibu.
2. [idibu webservices](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/webservices) - where you are welcome to try to get all the info you need about applicants, posted jobs, users, quotas... Basically build your own multiposting system!
3. [UPP](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/UPP) - Universal Partner Page integration - basically a "plug and play" multiposting system.
4. [idibu whitelabel](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/whitelabel) - Provide your clients with multiposting services with no developement what so ever!
