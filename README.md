idibu integration APIs
=========

idibu provides you with means of using our funtionality precisely how you would like it to run with your software! One can choose from a variety of integration options. Those can either quickly introduce multiposting for you clients (our current record holder took 2 days to roll-out a working integration!) or you can rebuild almost the whole of idibu inside your product.

Not only that, we also give you options to whitelabel our website and fit it into yours - so you can have your own private idibu almost instantly.

Before you choose the prefered integration type, make sure to read <a href="https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/before-you-begin.md">this</a> article.

The documentation is divided in the following options:

1. [idibu API](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/api-v3) - where you can learn all about how to post jobs using idibu.
2. [idibu webservices](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/webservices) - where you are welcome to try to get all the info you need about applicants, posted jobs, users, quotas... Basically build your own multiposting system!
3. [UPP](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/UPP) - Universal Partner Page integration - basically a "plug and play" multiposting system.
4. [idibu whitelabel](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/whitelabel) - Provide your clients with multiposting services with no developement what so ever!

Please note that these applets are designed for the clasic idibu platform (often refered as "idibu V2"). The newest idibu version (also known as "idibu V3") is compatible in some instances with those APIs. However the newest platform's API docs can be found [here](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-v3-api).
